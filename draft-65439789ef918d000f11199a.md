As a developer working in a team with a design system, having one place to do a design review and document how each widget in the system works can save time and reduce the redundancy of explaining the same thing over and over again. Widgetbook, inspired by Strorybook, is built to address these inconveniences. I want to share how I got started with Widgetbook in a very simple and manual way. As a documentation tried to cover too much and had me go back and forth for a few times.

## Install Widgetbook Package
