As a developer working in a team with a design system, having one place to do a design review and document how each widget in the system works can save time and reduce the redundancy of explaining the same thing over and over again. Widgetbook, inspired by Strorybook, is built to address these inconveniences. I want to share how I got started with Widgetbook in a very simple and in manual way so we can get a better understanding of how the package works. As a documentation tried to cover too much and had me go back and forth for a few times. Let's get started with our usual counter app.

## Create flutter project

```plaintext
flutter create widgetbook_app
```

## Install Widgetbook Package

```plaintext
flutter pub add widgetbook
```

## Return Widgetbook.material instead of MaterialApp

## Create folder structure

Folder &gt; Component &gt; Usercases

## Run it

## Addons
