As a developer working in a team with a design system, having one place to do a design review and document how each widget in the system works can save time and reduce the redundancy of explaining the same thing over and over again. Widgetbook, inspired by Strorybook, is built to address these inconveniences. I want to share how I got started with Widgetbook in a very simple and manual way so we can get a better understanding of how the package works. As a documentation tried to cover too much and had me go back and forth a few times. Let's get started with our usual counter app.

## Create Flutter project

```plaintext
flutter create widgetbook_app
```

## Install Widgetbook Package

```plaintext
flutter pub add widgetbook
```

## Return Widgetbook.material instead of MaterialApp and Run it

At this point, you should be able to run a blank project of widgetbook. It is always a good practice to test building your project before adding any config or components, just to make sure our package and dependency work.

## Create folder structure

You can easily understand the usage of each Widgetbook widgets with following structure. It is similar to creating folders in File Explorer of any operating system.

Folder &gt; Component &gt; Usercases

WidgetbookFolder &gt; WidgetbookComponent &gt; WidgetbookUsecase

A page to demonstrate widgets will be created in WidgetbookUsecase. I personally just returned a Scaffold widget and content to show in a body property.

## Addons

Addons are ready-to-use tools to help developer visualize their widgets, which otherwise will take much longer. Widget books make these tools very simple and convenient to implement.
