Dark mode in Flutter is very simple to implement. However, if the developer did not implement this feature early on it could be a cumbersome task to change it later.

The implementation is straightforward as it specifies themes for each dark and light mode and then toggles states between the two. The example below shows a minimalistic setup starting from the counter app.

## Specify the theme for dark mode.

In `MaterialApp` widget specifies a `ThemeData()` for dark mode with `darkTheme:`.

```dart
class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({super.key});

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Flutter Demo',
      theme: ThemeData.light(), // <-- Specify dark ThemeData().
      darkTheme: ThemeData.dark(), // <-- Specify dark ThemeData().
      home: const MyHomePage(title: 'Flutter Demo Home Page'),
    );
  }
}
```

In the example, I use a named constructor `ThemeData().dark()` for convenience. In an app with a more specific color scheme for a dark theme, you can create a custom ThemeData and specify it here. And also so simply supply light theme in `theme: ThemeData.light()` for simplicity.

# Manage state for change themes.

`flutter pub add flutter_riverpod`
