Text input in Flutter is simple to use. But when we want certain behaviors to occur each property, e.g. maxline and minline, when combined, has some unpredictable behavior when we try to understand their usage for the first time. In this article, I will provide you with examples for each behavior and its code example.

## Behavior 0: no max and min line.

## Behavior 1: max line only.

## Behavior 2: min line only.

## Behavior 3: Max line and min line together.

This could be what most people looking for when we need text fields to expand as users type but start like normal text fields, `minLine`\= 1
