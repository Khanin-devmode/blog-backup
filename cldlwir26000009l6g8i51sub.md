As a self-taught developer or developer in general. We learned new stuff regularly, but like everything, if you don't use it enough it will just get harder to recall. Journaling has always helped me.

This blog will be my digital journal where I record what I found, what I learned and what I think would benefit other developers for my sharing. If you find my later articles help you somehow please let me know, that would be much appreciate! :)
