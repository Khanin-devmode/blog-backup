When developing a package in Flutter, it's crucial to manage what classes are exposed to the user and to regulate how these classes are imported. Without such control, making updates to the package could become challenging and difficult to maintain due to potential conflicts arising from improper import paths. Let's delve into an example for clarity.

I have experienced a project that has files which import tag filled the page when it first open. This is problematic in term of maintainability and beauty. You will be surprise how these problems can easily be prevented. Let's compare between these two project structure.
